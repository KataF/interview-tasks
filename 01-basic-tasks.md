## General Programming Tasks

You can use language of your choice to solve these tasks. 
Try to use best programming practices when writing solutions.
Focus more on code readability and coding conventions, not trying to 
create the most efficient and compact solution (which are often 
really hard to read/understand).

### Problem 1

Write a function that combines two lists by 
alternatingly taking elements. 

For example: given the two lists ```[a, b, c]``` and ```[1, 2, 3]```, the 
function should return ```[a, 1, b, 2, c, 3]```.

### Problem 2

Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. 
By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, 
and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. 

For example, here are the first 10 Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.


### Problem 3

Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing 
between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result 
is always 100. 

For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100.
